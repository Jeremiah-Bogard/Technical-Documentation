        <p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is not a programming language. It is a markup language that tells web browsers how to structure the web pages you visit. It can be as complicated or as simple as the web developer wants it to be. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, wrap, or mark up different parts of content to make it appear or act in a certain way. The enclosing tags can make content into a hyperlink to connect to another page, italicize words, and so on.  For example, consider the following line of text:</p>
        
        <div class="exampleRslt">Hello World</div>
        
        <p>This text was generated by code using the &#60;p&#62; element. The p stands for paragraph. So in html the text would look like this:</p>
        
        <div class="exampleCode"><code>&#60;p&#62;Hello World&#60;/p&#62;</code></div>
        
      </section>
      
      <section class="main-section" id="The_Meaning">
        
        <header>
          <h2>The Meaning</h2>
        </header>
        
        <p>So I know how to write text but what exactly does it mean? How does it work? What makes it do what is does?</p>
        <p>To write code in html we use tags. There are thousand upon thousands of different tags, but we will just stick with the &#60;p&#62; tag for know.</p>
        <p>For every paragraph you write you need an opening and a closing tag. In between the tags is the content you wish to display. Let's take our example from earlier. So we have our Hello World text inclosed in some &#60;p&#62; tags:</p>
        <div class="exampleCode"><code>&#60;p&#62;Hello World&#60;/p&#62;</code></div>
        
        <p>Now what is it doing</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Opening Tag</strong>: The opening tag is the "&#60;p&#62;" part. This bit of code tells the html interperter that we are writing a paragraph.</li>
          <li><strong>Content</strong>: The content is our text "Hello World". This is the content that our paragraph contains. It is telling the html interperter to display this text to the screen.</li>
          <li><strong>Closing Tag</strong>: The closing tag is the "&#60;/p&#62;". It ends the paragraph. Basically it explains to the html interperter that the paragraph has ended. And everything between the opening tag and this one needs to be display on the screen.</li>
        </ul>
